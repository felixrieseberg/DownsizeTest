## Downsize 'words: "0"' test
It's pretty likely that you don't care about this miniscript, unless you came here on purpose.

This miniscript takes a bunch of HTML strings as found in /tests/ and runs them through Downsize with `words: "0"`, printing the results either in the console or into a file.

### Why in the world...?
I'm testing things here. It's for Ghost.
