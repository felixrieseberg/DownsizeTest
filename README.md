## Downsize 'words: "0"' test
It's pretty likely that you don't care about this miniscript, unless you came here on purpose.

This miniscript takes a bunch of HTML strings as found in /tests/ and runs them through Downsize with `words: "0"`, printing the results either in the console or into a file.

###Usage
Run `node index`. A prompt will ask you for the test you want to run (which should correspond to a *.json file in `.\tests\`), another prompt will ask whether or not to write the results to `results.txt`. 

## Why in the world...?
I'm testing things here. It's for Ghost.
